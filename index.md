# Emotion Detection with Machine Learning
This project utilizes OpenCV and scikit learn on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B to categorize the emotion of a face into one of 8 categories. This is done with HOG-SVM (Histogram of Oriented Gradients and Support Vector Machines) trained on the [Facial Expressions Dataset by muxspace](https://github.com/muxspace/facial_expressions) and a live webcam to feed in data.

I also finished preprocessing the [Facial Expressions Dataset](https://github.com/muxspace/facial_expressions.git), which categorizes over 13,000 pictures into 8 expressions. 

  
# Second Milestone - Training the Model
