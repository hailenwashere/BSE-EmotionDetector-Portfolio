# Emotion Detection with Machine Learning
This project utilizes OpenCV and scikit learn on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B to categorize the emotion of a face into one of 8 categories. This is done with HOG-SVM (Histogram of Oriented Gradients and Support Vector Machines) trained on the [Facial Expressions Dataset by muxspace](https://github.com/muxspace/facial_expressions) and a live webcam to feed in data.

# First Milestone - Setting Up and Preprocessing
The first milestone of my project was setting up the Raspberry Pi. After downloading the Raspberry Pi imager from the Raspberry Pi [website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/), I used a SD card reader to download Raspbian, the latest OS for Raspberry Pis, on the micro sd. With the OS and other necessary parts such as the HDMI cable and the heatsinks, I was able to boot up my Raspberry Pi.

Next was starting on the code for this project. I finished preprocessing the [Facial Expressions Dataset](https://github.com/muxspace/facial_expressions.git), which categorizes over 13,000 pictures into 8 expressions after a long time due to complications with my process. 

For example, I initially ran my code on Google Colab, which, unfortunately could not save a fully preprocessed version of my dataset in the form of a pickle file.
